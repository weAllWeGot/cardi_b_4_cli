Hope to extend the functionality and the api it uses to include more artists and deeper catalogues.

### Install

```
$ npm install -g cardib4cli
```

#### Execute on startup

To print out a Cardi B bar every time you launch a new shell, you will
need to configure your shell so that this command runs on startup.

**Bash**

```
$ echo 'cardib4cli' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

**Zsh**
```
$ echo 'cardib4cli' >> ~/.zprofile 
```

**Fish**
```
$ echo 'cardib4cli' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
